                increasingly competitive. Developers are under <br>
                constant pressure to build mobile apps that are <br>
                faster and better equipped to meet the expectations.You’ve got to start with the customer experience and
                work back toward the technology – not the other way around.

            <h3>Best Practices for Mobile <br> App Development</h3>
            <p class="bottom-para">
                A mobile application should be user-friendly <br> and this can be accomplished if sufficient attention
                has been paid to the GUI. A ‘usable’ app will drive adoption and acceptance rates which will determine
                it’s eventual success. A good development plan will ensure that the application retains its look and
                feel across platforms to offer a consistent UX.

                A mobile application is going to be ultimately <br> used by individuals who you may have never met. <br>
                So, the process of mobile app creation needs to begin with a definition of the target audience. It is
                important to pay heed to who will use the app, what are their challenges and how the app will help
                address them.This will be usefull in future.
